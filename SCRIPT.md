# INT. TARDIS - SUNROOM

The GAME MASTER (GM) and THE DOCTOR, dressed with a the 13th Doctor’s COAT and SHIRT and equipped with a SONIC-SCREWDRIVER and with a uv light which can read invisible ink MESSAGES, greets a group of invited COMPANIONS.

**GM**
> Welcome companions, Doctor, here are the rules and instructions.

We hear a DISTRESS SIGNAL.

**MESSAGE**
> It’s a distress call from the 28th century human-controlled space. What do you want to do?		

*The Doctor presumably answers to help out.*

The TARDIS MATERIALIZES. The GM opens the door and leads The Doctor and Companions through.

# INT. HMS PASTEUR AFT - KITCHEN & COMPUTER ROOM

The group enters the spaceship the HMS PASTEUR, named for the French scientist. There are large MEDICINE BOXES that are clearly labelled for the destination of CELEBRATION STATION. There is a WALKIE-TALKIE in the room. The TARDIS DEMATERIALIZES.

**MESSAGE**
> The TARDIS, sensing incoming danger, has activated it’s emergency protocol and fled to nearby space.

A CAPTAIN is heard over the speakers.

**CAPTAIN**
> Hello? Who is there? I’m picking up some lifeforms.

The Doctor is given the opportunity to hold a conversation with the Captain.

**CAPTAIN**

> You’re onboard the RMS Pasteur. The ship is transporting important medicine but the crew has vanished. I was going to send a team over to fly the ship but there is an incoming wave of enemies. Probably what got the crew. If you can get the ship working and help me deliver the medicine, I’m willing to help you.

The Doctor is, again, given the opportunity to hold a conversation with the Captain.

**CAPTAIN**
> Great, you need to deliver the medicine to the Styx Market. It looks like you are in the aft of the ship. First you need to get life support working again and then get inside the bridge. The ship is programmed to provide a tutorial how to fly when you get there.

**CAPTAIN**
> Remember, deliver the goods to the Styx Market

The group must complete a series of puzzles in order to fix the OXYGENATOR. There are two HOSES and three JUGS with markings at 3 UNITS, 5 UNITS and 8 UNITS. Only the 8 UNITS jug is full of water. The crew must create exactly 4 UNITS of water in two jugs and place them under the hoses.

The group must complete a teamwork activity in order to OPEN THE SECURITY DOORS. There are three ACCESS TERMINALS setup so that no screen can be seen from the others. Each terminal displays a the terminal number, a COLORED COLOR NAME where the color does not match the word, a collection of 6 COLOR NAMES and 6 COLOR RECTANGLES, and a TIMER of ~~10~~ **30** seconds. The group must tap on the color name that matches the color name from one of the other terminals (labeled) and similarly the color rectangle that matches the color of the name from the other terminal (also labeled). The COLORED COLOR NAME changes when the timer runs out and the timer resets. If all three terminals have the correct color name and color rectangle chosen the doors will "open".

The GM notices all panels display `Access Granted` at the same time and announces the bridge is open. The group proceeds through the door.

# INT. HMS PASTEUR BRIDGE - LIVING ROOM

The group moves in to the BRIDGE where the ships STATIONS are set up and running EMPTY EPSILON. The HELM (Matthew’s Laptop with joystick) and WEAPONS are on a table by the wall. On the wall is projected the MAIN SCREEN. SCIENCE and RELAY are on stands on opposite sides of the couch. ENGINEERING (SummerRay’s Laptop, touchscreen) is on another stand located ???????. The middle of the couch is decorated as the CAPTAIN’S CHAIR with a view of the main screen. A HAILING SIGNAL is heard.

**CAPTAIN**
> Good, I can see that you have made it to the bridge. It is equipped with five stations: helm for steering, weapons for fighting, engineering for energy, science for scanning and relay for communications. In the middle is the captain’s chair who gives orders. Everyone should find a station. I’ll let my first mate give you an introduction to each station.

*Alternatively, the CAPTAIN can give the tutorial or it can be provided by an onboard emergency HOLOGRAM*

The companions take a seat at the stations. The Doctor sits in the captain’s chair.

The Empty Epsilon scenario begins with the ship in a relatively empty place in space with some asteroids. There is a ship the REAPER about 20u away. The SHIP’S LOG contains detail about the epidemic and emergency evacuation.

**FIRST MATE**
> First thing you are going to want to do is get closer to our ship so we can give covering fire. We will ease her out slow.

**FIRST MATE**
> Science, your station is in charge of scanning the sector and identifying ships. Locate our ship near the edge of your radar and click on it. It should look like a triangle. When you have our ship selected click the "Scan" button on the right side of the screen. Slowly move the slider until the scan gets a good lock.

The science station performs the scan.

**FIRST MATE**
> Great, you should be able to tell if a ship is a friend (green) or foe (red) with this scan and what type. You can perform a second scan to get tactical information about an object.

**FIRST MATE**
> Relay, you are up next. 

**FIRST MATE**
> Engineering, you are up next. 

**FIRST MATE**
> Helm, now you get a turn.

**FIRST MATE**
> Weapons, finally you get to see some action.

**FIRST MATE**
> Great, I think you all have the hang of it. Bring the medicine to our base. Then you can use the ship to scan the sector for your TARDIS or whatever you call it.

The GM changes the main screen. A DALEK appears on the screen.

**DALEK**
> You have entered Dalek space, identify yourself!

*The Doctor is given time to answer. If The Doctor does not answer "I’m The Doctor" or identify as the Doctor the Dalek asks again or with the next line.*

**DALEK**
> Negative. Deception detected. Identify yourself correctly!

*When The Doctor has been recognized, the Dalek will become nervous and more hostile.*

**DALEK**
> Prepare to be eliminated!

The main screen returns to Empty Epsilon. A wave of DALEK FIGHTERS is incoming.

**CAPTAIN**
> We’ve got company. I don’t see any lifesigns on these fighters, they must be drone. Defend yourself, but the main goal is to get to the station. We’ll give you fire support.

The Reaper and the HMS Pasteur both battle the fighters while continuing to the station. The Doctor can deliver the medicine to the Styx Market station or to Celebration Station.

## If the group takes the medicine to Styx Market:

**CAPTAIN**
> Thanks! This medicine will make us very, very rich. Good luck with your search.

## If the group takes the medicine to Celebration Station:

**CAPTAIN**
> Thanks! This medicine will make us very, very rich. Good luck with your search.

The Reaper attacks the HMS Pasteur.

Once the medicine has been delivered, the HMS Pasteur can scan the area for the TARDIS while continuing to fight Dalek Fighters. When the ship finds and collects the TARDIS the game is a WIN.

## When the TARDIS is found
The TARDIS MATERIALIZES. The door is locked.

The companions retrieve their invitations.

**INVITATION 1 - The Doctor**
> You are invited to a party in your honor.
> Come celebrate with all your COMPANIONS.
> Physical INVITATIONS are better.
> They HAVE a better feel than DIGITS and CODE.
> I hope you enjoy your birthday, this IS a milestone YEAR!

**INVITATION 2 - Digit = 1**
**INVITATION 3 - Digit = 9**
**INVITATION 4 - Digit = 8**
**INVITATION 5 - Digit = 9**

The group solves each invitation for a digit. The Doctor puts the digits in order and puts the code in the door. When 1989 has been entered, the door opens and the group enters.

# INT. TARDIS - GYM

The group enters the TARDIS where the POWER CRYSTAL is in the middle but OFF. There are multiple EXTENSION CORDS (rope with different 3d-printed ends).

The group attempts to get power from the wall to the crystal lamp in the center of the room. Unfortunately some of the cords need to be chained in a specific combination. Some cords are fixed in place and cannot be moved.

When the TARDIS is powered, it DEMATERIALIZES and the game is complete.

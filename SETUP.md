# INT. TARDIS - Prologue

*This is where the participants gather. This can be an entry room, enclosed porch, or just outside. The Doctor is given a costume and sonic screwdriver. The door they will enter in is covered in a TARDIS decoration. I used an enclosed porch so the door into the porch had a blue TARDIS door. Then the door into the house had a black TARDIS door since they were "in the TARDIS"*

## Tardis Doors

* Walmart Blue Rectangle Tablecloth - $1

* Walmart Black Rectangle Tablecloth - $1

* Walmart Black Spray Paint x2 - $1

* Walmart White Spray Paint - $1

* Cardboard for stencil or Stencil - HAS

* Sound Files - Included

For the outside door, use the blue table cloth. Paint 2 columns of 4 square outlines in black below a thin black bar at the top. Fill in the top two squares with white and then add a 3 column, 2 row grid for the windows. Use a stencil for the text "POLICE BOX" on the thin black bar.

For the inside door, use the black table cloth. Paint the same 2x4 squares and thin bar but this time do it with white spray paint. You can do the windows and text with white and black again but remember to mirror the words (flip the stencil over) since this is inside the TARDIS now.

## The Doctor Costume

* [Hot Topic 13th Doctor Shirt](https://www.hottopic.com/product/her-universe-doctor-who-thirteenth-doctor-cosplay-t-shirt-plus-size/11431367.html) - $23

* [Amazon Long Hooded Cardigan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075XLXFVN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - $17

* [Amazon Yellow Suspenders](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KPLMFGG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - $7

* Jeans - Had

This combination makes a quick 13th Doctor cosplay.

## Sonic Screwdriver

* [Hot Topic 13th Doctor Sonic Screwdriver](https://www.hottopic.com/product/doctor-who-the-thirteenth-doctors-sonic-screwdriver/11522304.html?_br_psugg_q=sonic) - $15

* [Amazon UV Markers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CPKYJNC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - $8

Take apart one of the UV markers and remove the UV LED. Carefully take apart the sonic screwdriver. Remove the LED and motor in the front and replace the LED with the UV one. In order for the UV to actually be effective, I had to drill most of the way through the crystal end from the inside and slide the LED up. The screwdriver no longer rotates but I had a separate one.

If this is above your skill you can decorate one of the markers like a sonic screwdriver with some clay or spray paint. This design was inspired by a 10th Doctor "secret message" sonic which uses the same principal (and has a secret message pen) so you can purchase that instead.![image alt text](image_0.jpg)

# INT. HMS PASTEUR AFT - Oxygenator and Access Puzzles

*You will need 3 rooms for the whole adventure. I have an open floor plan so I hung silver tarps with command hooks to divide the space into 3 rooms. Just make sure you have an easy spot to use as a door between the rooms.*

*In the aft of the ship is the cargo bay with some plot points, plenty of sonic screwdriver hints for the Doctor, and two puzzles to solve. One to get the "oxygenator" back online and another to gain access to the ship bridge.*

## Cargo Bay

* Now Vegetable Glycerin - $4

* Nerf Blasters - Had

* LED Lantern (or any futuristic healing looking thing, or first aid kit) - Had

* Boxes - Had

* Wifi Light - Had

* Walkie Talkies - Had

* Tarps - Had

I didn’t have a fog machine so I made some fog juice with the glycerin and to make the ship smoky. Don’t over do it, I had to open the windows and clear out the air because it was too foggy. I used the wifi light set to pulse on red to give a "red alert" effect.

Print the included "Printables". Staple the “emergency protocols” in the binder and leave it in the room. Attach the cargo labels to some boxes. Attach the “Trauma Beam” label to the lantern. Fill a box with nerf guns and place the “Reserve Arsenal” label on the outside”

## The Water Puzzle

* [Walmart 1.25 Gallon Jug](https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/15915152) - $5

* [Walmart 2.5 Gallon Jug](https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/15915151) - $8

* Walmart Gray Rectangle Tablecloth - $1

* 1 Gallon jug - Had

* Hoses - Had

This is modeled after the [Die Hard 3 water jug problem](https://www.math.tamu.edu/~dallen/hollywood/diehard/diehard.htm). For the jugs I used, 1 "unit" of water was 1 quart. Mark “3” at the 3 quarts line on the gallon jug, “5” on the 1.25 gallon jug, and “8” on the 2.5 gallon jug. Cover up all other markings. Place 8 quarts in the large jug and empty the others. Put the hoses in the top of the jugs.

## Door Access Code Puzzle

* 3 Tablets - Had

* Access Code Puzzle website - included

    * [https://matthewmmorrow.github.io/SciFiCode/#1](https://matthewmmorrow.github.io/SciFiCode/#1)

    * [https://matthewmmorrow.github.io/SciFiCode/#2](https://matthewmmorrow.github.io/SciFiCode/#2)

    * [https://matthewmmorrow.github.io/SciFiCode/#3](https://matthewmmorrow.github.io/SciFiCode/#3)

The door access puzzle runs on a simple HTML website. You can use the provided links or host it yourself. Place 3 tablets (phones or computers also work) around the room so the screens aren’t visible from each other. I used command strips to attach them to the wall. Load up a different link on each tablet. At the top where it says "Terminal #" make sure the number is different for each of the screens. The game master must pay attention to when all of the tablets codes say “Access Granted”.  **Note: I increased the timer to 30 seconds. It was originally 10 and that was too short. **

## Sonic Screwdriver Hints

* Walmart Blue Post-it notes - $3

List of hints:

* Near entry doorway - "TARDIS EMERGENCY RELOCATED"

* Near entry doorway - "MUST FIND TARDIS"

* Near one Access Panel - "Security Override Panel"

* Near door to bridge - "Bridge Access"

* Near oxygenator - "Oxygenator is offline."

* Anything else you want, I labelled the 3D printer "futuristic material fabricator"

# INT. HMS PASTEUR BRIDGE - Spaceship Simulator

## Space Simulator Mission

* Projector - Had

* 6+ computers - Had

* Joystick - Had

* Walmart Gray Rectangle Tablecloth - $1

This requires a good amount of setup. You will need computers running EmptyEpsilon, a free open-source starship bridge simulator similar to Artemis. Arrange them facing a large screen that is also hooked to a computer. That computer will display the bridge screen. This computer can also run the game but I ran into issues. Place a captains chair in the middle and the other computers towards the edges.The "Helm" will need the joystick. I recommend your players familiarize themselves with EmptyEpsilon beforehand, if not you will need to give an overview. Install the mission and models to EmptyEpsilon or use the zip file of the who game (both included). Run the game and start the mission “Search Party” on the computer that is the game server. Join the game from the other computers. I had a Weapons Station, Helm, Science, Tactical, Bridge, and Engineering. There are options in the game to do it with less. The mission has some surprises and ties in with the script and boxes in the aft of the ship.

Make a second TARDIS door and cover it with a gray rectangle table cloth. Remove the tablecloth when the TARDIS "materializes" when the players find it in the game.

For extra detail, you can install some audio software and do a "Skype" call into the space ship when they encounter some Daleks. This needs another computer. This uses a program called Reaper which gives the Dalek voice effect (included). You will also need VBCable which will add a new virtual microphone to Windows which you can select in Skype and output the sound from Reaper to VBCable. The program Webcamoid will let you play a video of a dalek talking (included) for a webcam. Call from the other computer with this all set up. In my game, when answering the call from the bridge screen it froze because it was running the game server on the same computer.

Another idea that didn’t pan out in my game was using some cardboard to dress the kids up as daleks and have them attack the players in the room with nerf guns. Of course that’s what the Trauma Beam (for healing) and the Reserve Arsenal come in.

# INT. HMS PASTEUR BRIDGE - Door Puzzle

List of hints:

* Door Lock - "FOUR DIGIT CODE"

## TARDIS Invitations and Door Code

* [Walmart Metallic Markers](https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/24312185) - $2

* [Walmart Rubber Cement](https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/19586015) - $3

* Walmart Blue Posterboard - $1

* JoAnns Blue Scrapbooking Paper - $4

* 4 digit lock - Had

The invitations were the most fun to make. They are based off the episode "Impossible Astronaut". Cut the posterboard to make an envelop. Make the invitations and send them out beforehand and instruct the guests to bring them. Of course, have extras in case everyone forgets. Each side of the invitation has a math problem for a single digit. In this case the code to the lock was “1989” but you can remake the invitations for whatever number is signification to you. Honestly after about 3 minutes of trying to work it out the players outsmarted me and just used the year.![image alt text](image_1.jpg)

# INT. TARDIS - Crystal Power Puzzle

List of hints:

* Console - "TARDIS NEEDS POWER"

## TARDIS Wiring and Crystals

* Walmart Orange Rectangle Tablecloth x3 - $1x3

* Walmart Orange Round Tablecloth x4 - $1x4

* Walmart Gold Round Tablecloth x2 - $1x2

* Walmart Black Spray Paint x2 - $1x2

* [Walmart 1/4in x 50ft rope](https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/174359631) - $5

* Dollar General 1/4in x 50ft rope - $4

* Home Depot 2x3x96 - $2

* Home Depot 2x2x96 x4 - $2x4

* Home Depot#15-1/2 x 1-1/4 in. 3-Penny Bright Steel Nails - $2

* Extension Cords x4 - Had

* Walmart Socket Adapter - $1.50x4

* Walmart Cable Ties - $2

* 6 Large Tomato Cages - Had

* 4 Medium Tomato Cages - Had

* Chicken wire - Had

With the wood, make a hexagonal or octagonal base which will be covered in the golden table cloth to look like the TARDIS center console. You can use a round table and it will be close enough. Stack 2 large tomato cages on top of each other and wrap the chicken wire on top. Cover with orange table cloth for the center crystal. Put a medium tomato cage on a large tomato cage at an angle (with zip ties). Cover with orange table cloth. Put a light inside each "crystal" which will be turned on when the cable puzzle is solved.

![image alt text](image_2.jpg)

For the puzzle, cut a 2x3 into 2 inch sections. Each will have holes drilled on one half of the piece and nails on the other to make a sort of symmetrical plug. There are different patterns. Attach 6 of the walls on the outside (again, command strips) and 6 to the center console (not just the table cloth). Next make the required rope plugs and cut rope to length and staple to the plugs. A diagram is included. You could make it far simpler. The players had to unplug some of the "cables" and then plug them back in. On a few pieces they had to combine plugs to make a longer cable to reach the corresponding plugs.

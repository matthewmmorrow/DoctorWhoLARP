# Introduction

Welcome! This is a Doctor Who themed LARP that was put on for a birthday party. One special person is "The Doctor" and the others are "The Companions". It challenges the participants to solve some tricky puzzles, work together, fix the TARDIS and pilot a spacheship. Wow, that's just like in the show!

# Overview
## Setting
The Doctor and Companions gather in TARDIS. After a brief introduction, they land on the interior cargo bay of a recently abandoned spaceship in the year 2719. The TARDIS, detecting danger, dematerializes away. They must find out what happened, and find a way to get the TARDIS back.

### Wiring Problem

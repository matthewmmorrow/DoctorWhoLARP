# Introduction

Welcome! This is a Doctor Who themed LARP that was put on for a birthday party. One special person is "The Doctor" and the others are "The Companions". It challenges the participants to solve some tricky puzzles, work together, fix the TARDIS and pilot a spacheship. Wow, that's just like in the show!

# Overview
## Setting
The Doctor and Companions gather in TARDIS. After a brief introduction, they land on the interior cargo bay of a recently abandoned spaceship in the year 2719. The TARDIS, detecting danger, dematerializes away. They must find out what happened, and find a way to get the TARDIS back.

## Puzzles
### Water Jug Puzzle
A classic make-X-amount-of-water puzzle.

### Security Access Panel
A timed excercise in communication.

### Combination Lock Code
Find the combination. The answer was with you all along.

### Wiring Problem
Can you arrange different lengths of wires and plugs to get the TARDIS working again?

## Space Ship Simulator
The middle scene of the game is a space ship simulator, using a custom written mission for the bridge simulator EmptyEpsilon. This can be performed with 3-8 players and needs computers for each.
